# mars-rover

A simple NodeJS/React app to simulate the Mars Rover solution

## TODO

Things to still add:

- when start state is all zeroes
- when start state starts with a zero then has a valid number
- when the start state is off the grid boundary
- when the end state is off the grid boundary
- some error messages rather than just an error state
